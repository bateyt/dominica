My name is Trey Batey. I'm a broadly-trained anthropologist with a  research focus in biological anthropology---primarily skeletal biology, bioarchaeology, and forensic anthropology. I'm also interested in paleodemography and paleoepidemiology and how these are related to the evolution of human life-history characteristics.
