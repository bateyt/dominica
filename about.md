My name is Trey Batey. I'm a broadly-trained anthropologist with a  research focus in biological anthropology---primarily skeletal biology, bioarchaeology, and forensic anthropology. I'm also interested in paleodemography and paleoepidemiology and how these are related to the evolution of human life-history characteristics.

With `dominica`, I'm exploring the use of R and other open-source tools to analyze the historical demography of Carib populations in the Commonwealth of Dominica.
